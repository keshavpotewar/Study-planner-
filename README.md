#  Smart Study Planner

## Problem Statement

Students often face challenges in organizing study schedules and tracking academic tasks effectively.
Without a structured plan, it becomes difficult to manage multiple subjects, deadlines, and daily study hours, which leads to stress, missed deadlines, and poor time management.

## Solution

 Smart Study Planner is a web application built with React + TailwindCSS that helps students:

- Add, edit, and delete study tasks.

- Organize tasks by subject and deadline date.

- Manage time with daily study hours allocation.

- Track progress with task completion indicators.

- Visualize overall progress with charts.

- Save tasks locally using LocalStorage (no backend required).

This ensures that students can stay productive, manage their workload effectively, and never miss an important deadline.

## Features

 Task Management – Add tasks with title, subject, and deadline.

- Date-wise Schedule – Automatically groups tasks by deadline into a structured schedule.

- Mark Completed – Track finished tasks with progress indicators.

- Progress Chart – Visual overview of completed vs pending tasks.

- LocalStorage Support – Tasks persist even after refreshing the page.
